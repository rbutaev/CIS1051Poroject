# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

4D Block Organizer

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Tetrimino's spawn anywhere off screen, and move across the screen. You control a center block, and your goal is to build up your center block by colliding with the tetrimino's, and lasting as long as possible without going off screen.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

We are going to have a center block that is controllable by the keyboard, and moves increments equal to the size of the block. Arrow keys move the block, and space bar rotates the block 90˚. Tetriminos spawn off screen, and move towards and past the center. If the center block collides with a tetrimino, the tetrimino is added onto the center block, and the center block is now larger. If any part of the center block goes off screen, the player loses and the game ends. The player is scored based on time. Tetriminos are deleted and nothing happens if they go off the screen.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

No.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The features outlined in our descriptive paragraph, minus the rotation ability for the player.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

GOOD outcome with the addition of rotation ability for the player.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

BETTER outcome, and the player earns score by making full squares out of tetriminos attached to the center block. When the player makes a square, the square is deleted and any outer tetriminos fall in towards the center.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We will research LöVE and PyGame, and decide which platform is best for the project. We will have to research a collision checking algorithm that works with complex tetrimino shapes. One teamate can program the tetrimino's, another can program the center block, and another can develop the alorgithms needed.
